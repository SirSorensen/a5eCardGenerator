Saving Throw
Charisma Negates

You imagine a creature you can see within range in a deconstructed and simplified form. The target must make a Charisma 

saving throw

. On a failed save, the target becomes a barely recognizable, abstracted version of itself until the spell ends.
An abstracted creature’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
At the end of each of its turns, an abstracted target repeats the saving throw to end the spell’s effect on it.

Cast at Higher Levels
You can choose one additional target for each slot level above 2nd.

Looking For The Main A5E Site?

Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition is an "advanced", standalone version of the 5E ruleset. It adds more customization and depth to the game. A5E is 100% compatible with 5E, however, it is a core ruleset. It includes everything you need to play. 
This website is a tools resource for A5E. Please click here to visit the main Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition website.

Open Beta Toolset

This is an OPEN BETA toolset, and is a work-in-progress. Content, appearance, and functionality are continually being added and tweaked. This is all part of the process. Please be patient!

Open Gaming Content Notice

Open Gaming Content and Creative Commons content can be found in the separate A5E System Reference Document, available to download as a PDF. This online toolset is not the A5ESRD and should not be used as a reference for open content.
