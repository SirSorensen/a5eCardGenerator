Looking For The Main A5E Site?

Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition is an "advanced", standalone version of the 5E ruleset. It adds more customization and depth to the game. A5E is 100% compatible with 5E, however, it is a core ruleset. It includes everything you need to play. 
This website is a tools resource for A5E. Please click here to visit the main Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition website.

Open Beta Toolset

This is an OPEN BETA toolset, and is a work-in-progress. Content, appearance, and functionality are continually being added and tweaked. This is all part of the process. Please be patient!

Open Gaming Content Notice

Open Gaming Content and Creative Commons content can be found in the separate A5E System Reference Document, available to download as a PDF. This online toolset is not the A5ESRD and should not be used as a reference for open content.
